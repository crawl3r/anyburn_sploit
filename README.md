# Anyburn 4.8 sploit
Anyburn 4.8 Local Overflow (SEH). Complete input was Unicode based so injected payload had to account for all bytes being padded with 00's. 

Was a fun one to build and definitely made me take a step back and study what was going on. This is currently still a bug in the latest version of Anyburn (4.8).

Thanks to Achilles for providing a PoC on exploit-db https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46002 and @rd_pentest for pointing me at this to gain more experience for my upcoming OSCE exam.
